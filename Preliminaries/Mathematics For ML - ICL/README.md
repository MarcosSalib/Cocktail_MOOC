# Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization

* As offered by [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) on 
  [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).
  
* I'm creating this repository as a reference. It mainly includes the programming assignments. 
Along the way, I've added some notes for clarification. 
I thought it might be helpful for recap.
