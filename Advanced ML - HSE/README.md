Advanced Machine Learning Specialization



As offered on Coursera, this [specialization] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml) provides deeper insights to various Machine Learning techniques. 

It consists of 7 courses:
	1. Introduction to Deep Learning
	2. How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers
	3. Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning
	4. Practical Reinforcement Learning
	5. Deep Learning in Computer Vision
	6. Natural Language Processing
	7. Addressing Large Hadron Collider Challenges by Machine Learning

I believe this is one of the best hands-on courses in the field. It's a resourceful place where basic knowledge is accompanied by programming assignments and references to articles and papers.

Besides the programming assignments, I've added some the slides with some comments every now and then.
