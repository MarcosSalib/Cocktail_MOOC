# Machine Learning

This repository represent the complete lecture material for [Machine Learning](https://www.in.tum.de/en/daml/teaching/winter-term-202021/machine-learning/) as taught by Prof. Dr. Stephan GÃ¼nnemann at TUM - WS21. It includes my solutions to both the exercise sheets and the programming assignments.

I preferred to upload the model answers of the exercise sheets as provided by instructor, instead of my own hand-writing; so they are more clear. However the programming assignments are my own.
I've also added my own lecture notes alongside some extra material (e.g. books, summaries); for sake of completeness.
