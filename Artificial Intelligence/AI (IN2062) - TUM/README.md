# Techniques in Artificial Intelligence (IN6062)


* These are my solutions for the programming assignments for [Techniques in Artificial Intelligence (IN2062)](https://campus.tum.de/tumonline/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=950494220&pSpracheNr=2) 
  as taught by [Prof. Matthias Althoff](https://www.in.tum.de/i06/people/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/) 
  at TUM WS21.

* For the programming assignments, it mainly followed [AIMA book](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) repository.
  I chose to include only the [CommonRoad](https://commonroad.in.tum.de/) assignment, since it is a totally seperate project.
  Here's the [original](https://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-search) repository as reference. 
  I've only kept the SMP folder.
