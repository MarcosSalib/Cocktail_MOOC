# TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

Programming assignments for TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate Specialization as offered on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/tensorflow-developer-professional-certificate/).

I'm creating this repository only as a reference, only notebooks are included.
However sometimes along the way, I've added some important notes for clarification. I thought it might be helpful for recap.
