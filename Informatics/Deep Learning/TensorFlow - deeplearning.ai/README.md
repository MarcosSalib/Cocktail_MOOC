# TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

* As offered on [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/tensorflow-developer-professional-certificate/).
I'm creating this repository as a reference. It mainly includes the programming assignments.
Along the way, I've added some notes for clarification. 
I thought it might be helpful for recap.
