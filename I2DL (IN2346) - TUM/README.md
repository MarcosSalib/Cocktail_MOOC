# Introduction to Deep Learning


This repository represents the complete lecture material for Introduction to Deep Learning [IN2346](https://niessner.github.io/I2DL/) as taught by Prof. Matthias Nie√üner at TUM - WS21. It includes my solutions to all the programming assignments.

for the sake of completeness, I've added my own lecture notes alongside some extra material (e.g. books, summaries).


Topics covered per week:
-----------------------------

1. Introduction
2. ML Basics - Linear Regression
3. Introduction to Neural Networks
4. Optimization - Backpropagation
5. Scaling Optimization to Large Data
6. Training NN - 1
7. Training NN - 2
8. Training NN - 3
9. Introduction to CNNs
10. Popular CNN Architectures
11. Recurrent Neural Networks
12. Advanced Topics

* Note that starting from week_7, the notebooks are amended to some extent, they are not following the original ones. I've added more notes, code and sometimes totally different implementation.
