# Introduction to Deep Learning


This repository represents the complete lecture material for [I2DL - IN2346](https://niessner.github.io/I2DL/) as taught by 
[Prof. Matthias Nie√üner](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/niessner-matthias) 
at TUM - WS21. It includes my solutions to 
all the programming assignments.
For completeness, I've added my own lecture notes alongside some extra material.
