* As offered by [NYU Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) on 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance)
by [Igor Halperin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-zRu4foAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)
This specialization aims to provide a more practical problems that are encountered in real life.


* I believe this is one of the best online resources in the field of Finance. 
It is worth noting however that the notebooks are outdated. 
Yet I believe the main concepts and ideas are still robust.
For this reason,
I have been working with TensorFlow v1. You can find the full packages under
`requirements.txt`.

* As usual, I have added my own personal notes every week, collecting 
the most important ideas. The notebooks might be slightly different from the original.
  

* There are 4 courses in this specialization.
   1. **Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance**
       * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
       * Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning
       * Introduction to Supervised Learning

   2. **Fundamental of Machine Learning in Finance**
       * Fundamentals of Supervised Learning in Finance
       * Core Concepts of Unsupervised Learning, PCA & Dimensionality Reduction
       * Data Visualization & Clustering
       * Sequence Modeling and Reinforcement Learning
   3. **Reinforcement Learning in Finance**
       * MDP and Reinforcement Learning
       * MDP model for option pricing: Dynamic Programming Approach
       * MDP model for option pricing - Reinforcement Learning approach
       * RL and INVERSE RL for Portfolio Stock Trading
   4. **Overview of Advanced Methods of Reinforcement Learning in Finance**
