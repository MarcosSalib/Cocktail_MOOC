# Practical Reinforcement Learning


As offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl?specialization=aml), this course is offering deeper insights about Reinforcement Learning.

I believe this is one of the best resources online about Reinforcement Learning. 
It provides a robust and practical knowledge about the field.
Here's the [original](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL) repository.

Topics covered per week:
   1. Introduction
   2. Value-based Methods
   3. Model-free RL
   4. Approximate (Deep) RL
   5. Policy-based Methods
   6. Exploration


I've included all the answers to the programming assignments, mainly using PyTorch. 
For completeness, I've also added slides with comments now and then. Sometimes, 
you will find some notes summarizing the main ideas discussed as well.
As per Coursera, this is a 6-week course, however I've added more updated notebooks
to match the remainder of the course as per the original repository.

Under "Research Papers", you can find some relatable research papers about specific topics.
