# Introduction to Deep Learning


* As offered on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning?specialization=aml) 
  by [HSE](https://www.hse.ru/en/). This is an advanced introduction for Deep Learning.
  Since it was offered almost 3 years ago, the projects are following 
  the [original](https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl-pytorch) repository.


* Topics covered per week:
    1. Intro to Optimization
    2. Intro to Neural Networks
    3. DL for Images
    4. Unsupervised Representation Learning
    5. DL for Sequences
    6. Final Project - Image Captioning

    
* For completeness, I've also added slides with some comments for illustration. 
I've added notes summarizing the main ideas discussed as well.
