### Cocktail_MOOC

* I've created this repository to contain multiple courses taken on- & off- campus.
The courses vary ranging across different fields,
mainly focusing on Artificial Intelligence in a broader sense.
The idea is to provide a concise and complete reference.

* I mainly included code and slides, however sometimes I add my personal notes about
the topics. Related research papers are also included. The aim is to provide an ease access for full course material. 
The contents belong to original authors, only answer code and notes are mine.

  
* This is an overview for the coursework as listed in this repository. They arranged by topics.<br>
*Hyperlinks* are for certificates if applicable.<br><br>
