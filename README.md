### Cocktail_MOOC

I've created this repository to contain multiple courses taken on- & off- campus. The courses varies ranging across different fields, mainly focusing on Artificial Intelligence in a broader sense.
The idea is to provide a concise and complete reference.

Besides slides, papers and books, I've added some notes; to facilitate access for the full course material. All answers better used as reference. Inside each folder, there is a clear mention for the original authors, only notes are personal.
