As offered by NYU Tandon School of Engineering on 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance), 

It aims to provide a more practical problems that are encountered in real life.
<br>
I believe this is one of the best online resources in the field.
As usual, I have added my own personal notes every week. There are also extra notebooks
written in PyTorch as only TensorFlow was supported. 

Four courses are:
   1. Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance
   2. Fundamental of Machine Learning in Finance
   3. Reinforcement Learning in Finance
   4. Overview of Advanced Methods of Reinforcement Learning in Finance
