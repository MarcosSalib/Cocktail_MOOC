As offered by NYU Tandon School of Engineering on 
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-reinforcement-finance), 

It aims to provide a more practical problems that are encountered in real life.
<br>
I believe this is one of the best online resources in the field of Finance. 
It is worth noting however that the notebooks are outdated. 
Yet I believe the main concepts and ideas are still robust.

For this reason,
I have been working with TensorFlow v1. You can find the full packages under
`requirements.txt`.

As usual, I have added my own personal notes every week, collecting 
the most important ideas. The notebooks might be slightly different from the original.


Four courses are:
   1. Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance
   2. Fundamental of Machine Learning in Finance
   3. Reinforcement Learning in Finance
   4. Overview of Advanced Methods of Reinforcement Learning in Finance
