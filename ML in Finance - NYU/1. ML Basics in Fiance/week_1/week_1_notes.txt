some notes...


* ML is a sub-field of AI that teaches computers to perform tasks from experience.
* AI deals with machines that achieve a human-level performance at specific tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, credit approvals, etc.
* Data Science uses statistics and ML to monetize information in data.

* The goal of learning in ML is the ability to generalize from data.

* Scalability of ML methods is often a major concern in industrial applications.
* M deals with both probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods.
* Most of available data for ML is unsupervised data.


[Rational AI Agent]

* AI agents can perceive a physical env in real time via sensors, or by reading digital data collected from an env.
* AI agents should select actions that are expected to maximize its performance measure.
* AI studies intelligent agents that perceive their env and perform actions to solve tasks that involve mimicking cognition functions of humans.


[Reinforcement Learning]

* RL is in a sense an intermediate case between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, as some feedback about right actions is available, but it is incomplete.
* RL does NOT force UL to behave in a similar way to SL using DL.

* Modeling corporate defaults is an exercise in Unsupervised Learning because we do not know the future.
* Reinforcement Learning is a suitable framework for portfolio optimization, even though it can also be done with Supervised Learning using some pre-specified models of the world.


[Perception Tasks]

* In Perception tasks in Finance involve RL. It turns out that expectations regarding the future are sometimes embedded in perception of today's environment. If this future is influenced by actions of rational agents, RL might be an appropriate framework.


[Tech vs Finance]

* Relevant data is often of a medium-to-large size.
* Financial data is typically non-stationary.
* The noise-to-signal is typically higher for financial data than for data used in Tech applications.
