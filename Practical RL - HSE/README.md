As offered on Coursera, [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-rl?specialization=aml) course is offering deeper insights about Reinforcement Learning.

Here's the [original](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL) repository.

Topics covered per week:
   1. Introduction
   2. Value-based Methods
   3. Model-free RL
   4. Approximate (Deep) RL
   5. Policy-based Methods
   6. Exploration


I've included all the answers to the programming assignments, mainly using PyTorch. For completeness, I've also added slides with comments every now and then. Sometimes, you will find some notes summarizing the main ideas discussed as well.

As per Coursera, this is a 6-week course, however I've added more updated notebooks to match the remainder of the course as per the original repository.

Under "Research Papers", you can find some relatable research papers about specific topics.
