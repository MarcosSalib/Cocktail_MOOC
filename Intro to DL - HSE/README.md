# Introduction to Deep Learning


As offered on Coursera, [this](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning?specialization=aml) course is offering deeper insights about Reinforcement Learning.

Here's the [original](https://github.com/hse-aml/intro-to-dl-pytorch) repository.

Topics covered per week:
   1. Intro to Optimization
   2. Intro to Neural Networks
   3. DL for images
   4. Unsupervised Representation Learning
   5. DL for Sequences
   6. Final Project


For completeness, I've also added slides with comments now and then. 
Sometimes, you will find some notes summarizing the main ideas discussed as well.
